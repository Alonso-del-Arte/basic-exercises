     * than the other.
     * @param b One of the two integers. May be negative, need not be smaller 
     * than the other.
     * @return The GCD as an integer.
     * If one of a or b is 0 and the other is nonzero, the result will be the 
     * nonzero number.
     * If both a and b are 0, then the result will be 0, which is perhaps 
     * technically wrong, but I think it's good enough for the purpose here.
